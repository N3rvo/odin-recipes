# The Odin Project: HTML Recipes Project
This is just a little project showing the skills learned in the first few sections of the Foundations Course in The Odin Project website.

Here we were tasked with doing a basic navigation flow for a couple of boilerplate pages describing some recipes, so I decided to have some fun !
