    <p>This is one of my favourites! It involves doing that thing you can do in video-games: Running!</p>
    <h3>It is pretty easy:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Find a suitable place to run by talking with friends or searching the internet.</li>
        <li>Choose a day to start running (it would be better if it is not a day far away, but that is up to you!)</li>
        <li><em>Gear up</em> and go to the place.</li>
        <li>Warm up nicely.</li>
        <li>It's time to start, make a stride with either of your feet.</li>
        <li>Now it gets tricky, make a smilar stride with the foot that was left behind.</li>
        <li>Repeat the lest step for as much time as you want.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>You are doing it! You are running, enjoy the ride!</h4>

    <p><em>Preparation Time:</em> the time it takes your spirit ajust.</p>
